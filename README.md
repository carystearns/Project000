# Project 0
// Hi there, thank you for looking at my first project.
This is my first webpage.
index.html includes a bootstrap alert, a link to titlestylesheet.css which comes
from titlestylesheet.scss.  It also includes a media query that I have set to 800px
I originally had it set to 500px and 499px like in the course but I couldn't shrink the chrome window enough to demonstrate on the video .

Monuments.html includes a table with pictures and a link to a css stylesheet

foodanddrink.html includes div class and span and css styling

epochs.html includes a bootstrap grid layout
